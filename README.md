"app.py" is the main application.

Before you launch "app.py," please open the "LinusTechTips" youtube channel "videos" page, make sure all content is loaded (scroll all the way down), download the loaded page through your web browser, then put the html and folder in the main "app.py" directory.


Currently, I am working on individual modules of code to later implement to app.py.

Individual modules are formatted: "#-ACTION.py"
